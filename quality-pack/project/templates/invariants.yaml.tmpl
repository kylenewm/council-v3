# invariants.yaml - Project-specific path protection
#
# Usage:
#   The mode injection scripts read this file and warn about forbidden/protected paths
#
# Customize this for your project

# Forbidden paths - ALWAYS blocked, no override
# Use for: credentials, secrets, sensitive configs
forbidden_paths:
  - "*.env"
  - ".env.*"
  - "credentials/*"
  - ".secrets/*"
  - "**/secrets.yaml"
  - "**/api_keys.json"

# Protected paths - blocked by default, require explicit approval
# Use for: schemas, migrations, production configs
protected_paths:
  # Uncomment and customize for your project:
  # - "api/schema.py"
  # - "migrations/*"
  # - "config/production.yaml"
  # - "docker-compose.prod.yaml"

# Notes (optional, for documentation)
notes: |
  Forbidden paths cannot be modified by agents under any circumstances.
  Protected paths require explicit approval from the user.

  Customize this file for your project:
  - Add sensitive files to forbidden_paths
  - Add files that need careful review to protected_paths
